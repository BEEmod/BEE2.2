### This is a legacy version of BEEmod.

This is the original implementation of the BEE2 application and precompiler. It is written in C# and only runs on Windows. This version is no longer maintained, very buggy, and not recommended for new maps.

See [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4) for the currently maintained version of BEEmod, or [BEE1.5](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEEMOD) for the original version which does not include an application at all.
