### Note, this version of the BEE2 is extremely outdated with many bugs, and should not be used for making maps.

For an up-to-date version of the mod, see the [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4). This version has been rewritten in Python, allowing it to be made cross-platform, and inlcudes lots of new items and functionality.

The [BEE1](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEEMOD) is also still available. Being a simple EditorItems replacement, this version of the mod is able to be used on all operating systems, including Linux, as well as systems which simply cannot run the BEE2.4 for one reason or another.

# BEE2.2
