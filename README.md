### Note, this version of the BEE2 is extremely outdated with many bugs, and should not be used for making maps.

This repository exists only for archival/reference purposes. For an up-to-date version of the mod, see the [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4).

The [BEE1](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEEMOD) is also still available. Being a simple EditorItems replacement, the BEE1 version of the mod is able to be used on all operating systems.

The BEE2.2 (this repository) is written in C#, and is only supported on Windows. 

The BEE2.4 has been rewritten in Python, allowing it to be made cross-platform, and includes lots of new items and functionality.
