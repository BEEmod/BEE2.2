You need to run "steam\steamapps\common\portal 2\StyleChanger.exe" once before using BEE2 to install the vbsp and vrad mods. That allows styles to work, makes previewing faster (low quality lighting), and allows in-game screenshots to be used when publishing. When previewing, you can hold Ctrl until the lighting step starts to see a full preview with correct lighting and elevators, or just hold Ctrl while pressing F9 for previewing with elevators.

To use BEE2, run the exe in the "steam\steamapps\common\portal 2\portal2_dlc2\BEE2" folder. Choose a style, choose a starting palette layout, then drag and drop items into your palette. You must click the File > Export menu to export the items to Portal 2. Your palette layout isn't saved unless you choose File > Save.

Items that aren't in your palette will still work if you load a map that has them, but you won't be able to add them. So for more items in your map than allowed in the palette, add a set of items in your map, save your map, then change the items in the palette, then load the map and add the new items.

known bugs in v.2:
duplicate items on palettes cause the first item to be selected when clicking on the second, you shouldn't even have two on the palette anyway :P
filter options for "Items Matching Style" and "Miscilanious" are broken

Many items don't work properly, or were made to lower standards than you are used to.

any other bugs send them to me at benvlodgi@gmail.com
